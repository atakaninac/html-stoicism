    <p>Epictetus is one of the most significant and renowned philosophers of the Roman imperial period. There is very little known about his life, and information mostly relies on later sources. </p>

    <p>Lucius Flavius Arrianus, who attended the school established by Epictetus in Nicopolis, recorded what he learned from Epictetus in this work, even though Epictetus himself did not write down his teachings, much like Socrates.</p>
